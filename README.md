Here's Hacksquad 2022, Make open source contributions and compete with tech geeks like you win awesome swags...

### Rules for PRs
- The PR is made on a DSA repository
- The PR is made just to +1 your PR count during the event
- The PR is on your own repo (We know valuable contributions can be done to your own repo, but in order to do this you need strong reasons)
- The PR is on a repo which simply asks you to list our XYZ project (e.g. script, web app list, python collection etc. etc.)
